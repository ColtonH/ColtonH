- 👋 Hi, I’m Colton Hurt!
- 👀 I’m interested in robotics, functional programming, and machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Golang for a server, flutter + dart, and any language I can get my hands on.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any type of robotics project that can help me move from my current job to one in the field of robotics.
- 📫 You can reach me @ coltonhurt@live.com

- My main developemnts are all done within GitLab per personal preference, but I still contribute here!
